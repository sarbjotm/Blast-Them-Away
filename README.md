# Exercise 10

For this exercise, I followed an old weekly exercise/tutorial for JQuery and Raphael. This tutorial was previously used in CMPT 165. A few changes (aesthetics wise) were made however

## Changes

A few changes were made to this tutorial. For instance, instead of a 200x200 board, the board has a size of 500x500. Additionally Part 1 has been turned into a game where the user has to click the blocks before they disappear or their misses counter increases. If the user successfully clicks the shape in time, their score goes up by 1.

Additionally, there also are ellipse that show up. So the user has the chance to see circles and squares.

Finally, for both part 1 and part 2 the colours are randomized for aesthetic.

## How To Play "Blast Them Away"
Enter the number of shapes you would like to appear then click on "Add More". Shapes will pop up and your objective is to click all of them before the animation ends. Successful clicks will see the "Clicks" go up, and if you miss the "misses" will go up.

## Circles Circles Circles
For this, all you have to do is click on "Add Another" Circles will start appearing, and increasing in size
